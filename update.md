This script combines the functionality of the previously discussed modules for cloning Git repositories, generating a report using PHPMetrics, and generating a report using the local-php-security-checker.
It uses the argparse library to parse command-line arguments, the os library to create directories, the git library (specifically the Repo class) to clone Git repositories, the phpmetrics_module and local_php_security_checker_module for generating reports.
It takes in three command-line arguments: a CSV file containing the repository information, a local directory to clone the repositories into, and an optional GitLab username and password.
The script reads the CSV file, clones the repositories into the specified local directory, and then generates reports using PHPMetrics and local-php-security-checker on each repository. The reports are saved in a folder named results in the local directory with the same name as the repository.
It also includes error handling to check if the command ran successfully and if the folders exists.
It also checks and deletes the existing folder if the cloning fails.
You can run this script by providing the necessary command-line arguments and making sure that the necessary modules and tools (git, phpmetrics, and local-php-security-checker) are installed and available on the system's command line.
